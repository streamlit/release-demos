This app provides a few key scenarios we think will be interesting with fragments:
- Two slow-loading charts with their own controls that run independently
- A dynamic form input that only runs the outer page on submission
- An observability-style chart that streams the latest updates every few seconds
- "Cell" of LLM-generated code in between two st.chat_messages
- Tracking and reporting status of a running job

ðŸ‘ˆ Take a look at the examples to try it.

"""
- Periodic rerun / streaming: Use the `run_every` kwarg to automatically rerun the fragment at a specified interval.
  This is great for streaming or polling chart updates, or updating progress on a long-running background task.
- Use `st.rerun()` inside a fragment to trigger a full app re-run. Store values in `st.session_state` to use them
  outside the fragment.
"""

with st.expander("ðŸ‘€ More details about `@st.experimental_fragment` behavior"):
    """
    Very roughly, you can think of fragments as an inverse or complement to caching functions.

    :warning: **Note:** Some behavior described here may change in the final released version.
    - When you interact with a widget initialized in a fragment, only the fragment code reruns with the user's new value.
    - A fragment can access function arguments as well as any local or global variables on the page, and session state.
    - Arguments and immutable variables will be set to the value at the last function execution during a full rerun.
    - Any updates in global variables or session state persist across fragment reruns.
    - Updates to mutable local variables like lists or Streamlit containers (!) are persisted across fragment reruns.
    - Each fragment has its own container that is reset for each fragment rerun, similar to how pages reset on rerun.
    - Streamlit containers and elements initialized outside the fragment are not reset across fragment reruns, even
      if they are modified by the function. If a fragment function writes to a container initialized outside itself,
      that container will show the cumulative updates from all fragment reruns since the last full rerun.
    """

st.subheader("Known limitations of the preview")

"""
This is a happy-path preview shared for community feedback with some known issues. We will address those
issues before a full release! In particular, interacting with widgets in a fragment while the app is already
running can cause execution to stop early, and widgets can behave oddly outside the "main" interaction path. 
"""

with st.expander("Details of limitations"):
    """
    - Interacting with a widget in a fragment during the initial page run will cause it to not completely
      load the page
    - Interacting with a widget in fragment A while fragment B is running will cause B to halt without completing
      (This is especially frequent for pages with `run_every=` set, such as "Streaming chart" and "Multiple fragments")
    - In the dynamic form example, some interactions with the selectbox will cause multiple submit buttons to draw
    - In general, interacting with global state or containers created outside the fragment function can lead to
      non-intuitive or otherwise unexpected results.
    - Fragment functions running can stop some functionality of set_page_config
    - Interactions between caching and st.experimental_fragment are not well tested

    Let us know what you find as you experiment with the preview!
